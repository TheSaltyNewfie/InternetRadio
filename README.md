# InternetRadio
I have no other ideas for the name other than that, as it says what it does

# What does it do?
I got bored and wanted to host my own internet radio for a bit of fun, the software that is available for this isnt great
so I am doing it myself.

# What can I do with it?
Eventually I want to implement it into a discord bot kinda like how I implemented other internet radios into my own discord bot

# Timeline?
I do not have a timeline at the moment as I am currently juggling multiple things but eventually things will work
